SatRdays Remote 2022
============================

Would anyone in my network be interested in presenting a french language R talk in June? Speakers from Francophone Africa strongly encouraged to give presentations.

The objective is to create a 20 minute talk about a project that uses R code. The presentation will be presented virtually, and can be recorded in advance. 

Volunteers are needed to help organize the event

#### Principal Requirements

There are two main requirements: People would like to give presentations, and people would like to assist in organizing the conference. It would be fantastic for people in West Africa to be involved in both components.
